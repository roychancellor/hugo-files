Projects on this page illustrate reactive and proactive problem solving projects I worked on either directly as a team leader or as an advisor to the primary project team.  The projects show how Shainin Red X and Green Y methods can quickly converge on the root cause of a technical problem.


# Reactive Problem Solving

Reactive problem solving occurs when a problem already exists and needs attention, whether it be for a line-down situation or to eliminate chronic problems. The essence of the [Shainin Red X](https://shainin.com) method is a binary search which can converge rapidly on the root cause. Executing the binary search is based on measuring the product and process in specific ways that provide clues about where the problem lives and does not live. An example would be changing the orientation of a part halfway through the process to see if if the defect follows the part or the process.

* [Non-uniform deposit thickness](https://roychancellor.github.io/project_portfolio/Reactive_NonuniformThickness.pdf) (delivered at the 2004 Shainin Symposium in Detroit, MI): See how shimming on a seemingly insignifcant machine in the back room of the factory eliminated dim edges of EL lamps at the customer.
* [Cracking in printed carbon layer](https://roychancellor.github.io/project_portfolio/Reactive_CarbonCracking.pdf):  Eliminated "mud cracking" of a printed carbon-based ink during drying.
* [Visual defects on printed panels (V lines)](https://roychancellor.github.io/project_portfolio/Reactive_VLines.pdf):  Eliminated "V line" visual defects with a clever change to machine timing that prevented ink dripping during screen printing.

# Proactive Problem Solving

Proactive problem solving is the process of preventing problems before full-scale production by stressing the process to see how it breaks and fixing those problems using reactive strategies. It also involves identifying problems from previous similar problems, scoring the risk of recurrence, and working to lower the risk before production.

* [Printed skin sticking to subtrate](https://roychancellor.github.io/project_portfolio/Proactive_SkinSticking.pdf): Eliminated this show-stopping problem during development of a critical-to-success new product that enabled launch with factory-level yields instead of < 20% yield seen in prototype runs.
* [New substrate qualification](https://roychancellor.github.io/project_portfolio/Proactive_NewSubstrateQualification.pdf):  Demonstrated statistically equivalent performance of a second-source substrate that had significantly lower cost.
