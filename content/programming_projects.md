All of my personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/roychancellor).  Below are some projects I am particularly proud of:


# ProjectEuler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a collection of challenging math problems solved with programming. I have used these problems for intellectual stimulation and to practice coding in Java. Problem descriptions are [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).  My repository is [here](https://github.com/roychancellor/ProjectEuler) and below are a few I am proud of:

* [Problem #12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12): Find the first triangular number that has at least 500 divisors
* [Problem #13](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13): Find the first 10 digits of the sum of 100 fifty-digit numbers
* [Problem #15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15): Find the number of paths through a 20 x 20 grid
* [Problem #16](https://projecteuler.net/problem=16): Find the sum of the digits in 2^1000 (Wish I knew about BigDecimal before this one!)
* [Problem #17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17): Total number of letters used to write out 1-1000 in words
* [Problem #20](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20): Find the sum of the digits in 100! (BigDecimal...dang)

# Java Projects

Programs written as part of the [GCU Java Programming Certificate](https://www.gcu.edu/degree-programs/java-programming-certificate).

* [Banking Application](https://github.com/roychancellor/GCU/tree/master/CST105%20Banking):  Implements simple banking features (like an ATM) as a Java console application using object-oriented concepts. Extensions include adding date/time stamp of each transaction and storing each transaction in and ArrayList of strings for later retrieval.

# C Projects

This [repository](https://github.com/roychancellor/C_CPP) contains programs I wrote over a period of many years beginning in grad school and recently as a math teacher either for demonstration or while teaching C to students. A couple of projects that show I can code in C as well:

* [Polynomial root finder](https://github.com/roychancellor/C_CPP/tree/master/PolyRootFinder): Finds all real and complex roots of polynomials from degree 1 to degree 8. Demonstrates the rational root theorem, Descartes' rule of signs, and implements Bairstow's method for roots of degree 3 or higher.
* [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://github.com/roychancellor/C_CPP/tree/master/FFT):  Computes the FFT of a set of data read in from a file. COMING SOON.
