All of my personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/roychancellor).  Below are some projects I am particularly proud of:


# ProjectEuler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a collection of challenging math problems solved with programming. I have used these problems for intellectual stimulation and to practice coding in Java.  Archives of the problems are [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

* Find the first triangular number that has at least 500 divisors [Problem #12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)
* Find the first 10 digits of the sum of 100 fifty-digit numbers [Problem #13](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13)
* Find the number of paths through a 20 x 20 grid [Problem #15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)
* Find the sum of the digits in 2^1000 [Problem #16](https://projecteuler.net/problem=16)
* Total number of letters used to write out 1-1000 in words [Problem #17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)
* Find the sum of the digits in 100! [Problem #20](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20)

# Java Projects

Programs written as part of the [GCU Java Programming Certificate](https://www.gcu.edu/degree-programs/java-programming-certificate).

* [Banking Application](https://github.com/roychancellor/GCU/tree/master/CST105%20Banking):  Implements a simple bank as a Java console application. Extensions include adding date/time stamp of each transaction and storing each transaction in and ArrayList of strings for later retrieval.
