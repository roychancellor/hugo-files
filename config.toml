  About = "Welcome! I have been programming most of my life, starting with BASIC on a Commodore PET, moving to the TRS-80, TI-99/4A, Apple II, and finally the PC. Ironically, during my mechanical engineering degree programs it was learning the C language that proved invaluable for simulating dynamic systems, acquiring data, controlling mechanical systems, and performing mathematical analysis. After 14 years working in engineering and 11 years as a math teacher, I am coming full circle to start a career as a Java developer. I am currently at GCU acquiring Java skills and will (hopefully) start work mid-September. Check out the content in the menu above for more about my past and present work."
